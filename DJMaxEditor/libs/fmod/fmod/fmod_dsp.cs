        For a boolean, you can use min = 0.0, max = 1.0, step = 1.0.  This way the only possible values are 0.0 and 1.0.<br>
        Some applications may detect min = 0.0, max = 1.0, step = 1.0 and replace a graphical slider bar with a checkbox instead.<br>

        Note.  Every time the delay is changed, the plugin re-allocates the echo buffer.  This means the echo will dissapear at that time while it refills its new buffer.<br>
        Larger echo delays result in larger amounts of memory allocated.<br>
        <br>
        '<i>maxchannels</i>' also dictates the amount of memory allocated.  By default, the maxchannels value is 0.  If FMOD is set to stereo, the echo unit will allocate enough memory for 2 channels.  If it is 5.1, it will allocate enough memory for a 6 channel echo, etc.<br>
        If the echo effect is only ever applied to the global mix (ie it was added with System::addDSP), then 0 is the value to set as it will be enough to handle all speaker modes.<br>
        When the echo is added to a channel (ie Channel::addDSP) then the channel count that comes in could be anything from 1 to 8 possibly.  It is only in this case where you might want to increase the channel count above the output's channel count.<br>
        If a channel echo is set to a lower number than the sound's channel count that is coming in, it will not echo the sound.<br>

        Flange is an effect where the signal is played twice at the same time, and one copy slides back and forth creating a whooshing or flanging effect.<br>

        Flange depth is a percentage of a 10ms shift from the original signal.  Anything above 10ms is not considered flange because to the ear it begins to 'echo' so 10ms is the highest value possible.<br>

        FMOD_DSP_TREMOLO_DUTY and FMOD_DSP_TREMOLO_SQUARE are useful for a chopper-type effect where the first controls the on-time duration and second controls the flatness of the envelope.<br>
        FMOD_DSP_TREMOLO_SPREAD varies the LFO phase between channels to get an auto-pan effect. This works best with a sine shape LFO.<br>

        [REMARKS]
        Normalize amplifies the sound based on the maximum peaks within the signal.<br>
        For example if the maximum peaks in the signal were 50% of the bandwidth, it would scale the whole sound by 2.<br>
        The lower threshold value makes the normalizer ignores peaks below a certain point, to avoid over-amplification if a loud signal suddenly came in, and also to avoid amplifying to maximum things like background hiss.<br>
        <br>
        Because FMOD is a realtime audio processor, it doesn't have the luxury of knowing the peak for the whole sound (ie it can't see into the future), so it has to process data as it comes in.<br>
        To avoid very sudden changes in volume level based on small samples of new data, fmod fades towards the desired amplification which makes for smooth gain control.  The fadetime parameter can control this.<br>

        Parameter types for the FMOD_DSP_TYPE_PITCHSHIFT filter.

        [REMARKS]
        This pitch shifting unit can be used to change the pitch of a sound without speeding it up or slowing it down.<br>
        It can also be used for time stretching or scaling, for example if the pitch was doubled, and the frequency of the sound was halved, the pitch of the sound would sound correct but it would be twice as slow.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Warning!</b> This filter is very computationally expensive!  Similar to a vocoder, it requires several overlapping FFT and IFFT's to produce smooth output, and can require around 440mhz for 1 stereo 48khz signal using the default settings.<br>
        Reducing the signal to mono will half the cpu usage, as will the overlap count.<br>
        Reducing this will lower audio quality, but what settings to use are largely dependant on the sound being played.  A noisy polyphonic signal will need higher overlap and fft size compared to a speaking voice for example.<br>
        <br>

        '<i>maxchannels</i>' dictates the amount of memory allocated.  By default, the maxchannels value is 0.  If FMOD is set to stereo, the pitch shift unit will allocate enough memory for 2 channels.  If it is 5.1, it will allocate enough memory for a 6 channel pitch shift, etc.<br>
        If the pitch shift effect is only ever applied to the global mix (ie it was added with System::addDSP), then 0 is the value to set as it will be enough to handle all speaker modes.<br>
        When the pitch shift is added to a channel (ie Channel::addDSP) then the channel count that comes in could be anything from 1 to 8 possibly.  It is only in this case where you might want to increase the channel count above the output's channel count.<br>
        If a channel pitch shift is set to a lower number than the sound's channel count that is coming in, it will not pitch shift the sound.<br>

        [REMARKS]
        Chorous is an effect where the sound is more 'spacious' due to 1 to 3 versions of the sound being played along side the original signal but with the pitch of each copy modulating on a sine wave.<br>
        This is a highly configurable chorus unit.  It supports 3 taps, small and large delay times and also feedback.<br>
        This unit also could be used to do a simple echo, or a flange effect.

        This is effectively a software based echo filter that emulates the DirectX DMO echo effect.  Impulse tracker files can support this, and FMOD will produce the effect on ANY platform, not just those that support DirectX effects!<br>

        [REMARKS]
        Note.  Every time the delay is changed, the plugin re-allocates the echo buffer.  This means the echo will dissapear at that time while it refills its new buffer.<br>
        Larger echo delays result in larger amounts of memory allocated.<br>
        <br>
        For stereo signals only!  This will not work on mono or multichannel signals.  This is fine for .IT format purposes, and also if you use System::addDSP with a standard stereo output.<br>

        This is a simple linked multichannel software limiter that is uniform across the whole spectrum.<br>

        [REMARKS]
        The parameters are as follows:
        Threshold: [-60dB to 0dB, default 0dB]
        Attack Time: [10ms to 200ms, default 50ms]
        Release Time: [20ms to 1000ms, default 50ms]
        Gain Make Up: [0dB to +30dB, default 0dB]
        <br>
        The limiter is not guaranteed to catch every peak above the threshold level,
        because it cannot apply gain reduction instantaneously - the time delay is
        determined by the attack time. However setting the attack time too short will
        distort the sound, so it is a compromise. High level peaks can be avoided by
        using a short attack time - but not too short, and setting the threshold a few
        decibels below the critical level.
